#  NYC PAYROLL DATA INTEGRATION Project

## Project Introduction:
This is a project to integrate payroll data across all its recorded agencies.
The City of New York is embarking on a project to integrate payroll data across all its 
agencies. The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform to accomplish two primary objectives:
- Financial Resource Allocation Analysis: Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
-  Transparency and Public Accessibility: Make the data available to the interested public to show how the Cityâ€™s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.
